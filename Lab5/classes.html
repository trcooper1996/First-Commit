<h2>Relax Anytime with Savasana</h2>
<p>Prepare yourself for savasana. Lie down on your yoga mat with your arms at your side with 
palms up. Close your eyes and breathe slowly but deeply. Sink into the mat and let your 
worries slip away. When you are ready, roll on your side and use your arms to put yourself 
to a sitting position with crossed legs. Place your hands in a prayer position. Be grateful for 
all that you have in your life. Namaste.
